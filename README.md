# Todo-List-React-JS-Application.
I created todo list React JS application . I passed "props" to the todo item component for the text and completion status. I used the "UseState"hook in the todo list component to manage the list of todo items. Furthermore, i added the functionality to add new todo items and toggle completion status.
